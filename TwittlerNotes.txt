Twittler Notes

Basics:
- get array of messages via streams.home
	- not sure what dictates number of messages passed in each call/reference

Tasks:
Show new tweets
- initial disply of x tweets
	- format, put in list
	- make name & time small w/ different font
- call streams.home again
	- probably make a button for this and do an autoreferesh every 10-15 sec
- check if time of any new tweets are newer than top of current display
	- will use date objects and compare them
